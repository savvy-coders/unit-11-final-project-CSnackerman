        Hi! I'm Colby Ackerman from St. Louis, Missouri. 
        I like to go for bike rides and play video games with friends.
        I became interested in software development from playing games at a young age.
        It made me want to learn how to make them. Over time, I have come to love programming in the forms
        of web and game development. I want to learn about the full stack and it's many different forms
        for both of those types of development to express my creativity.
